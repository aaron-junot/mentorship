The Operation Code mentorship program serves to guide our community of service members and their families in their journey of learning to build software and starting a successful career in the tech industry.

# Programs

## 1 on 1

When you sign up as a mentor you'll identify a few key areas you're able to help in. We'll use these areas to match you up with members who are requesting a mentor. See *TBD* for more info

## Squads

The squad system is a way for Operation Code members to be grouped with mentors in order to work towards a common goal.
As a mentor you can either lead or help support a squad.

### Starting A Squad

To start a squad you will need to identify a few items first. *TODO: Create an airtables form?*

At a minimum you will need:
* A theme for the squad. This should be a finite, measurable goal the squad can work towards.
* At least 1 additional mentor to assist in the squad
* A minimum number of members required to start the squad
* A maximum number of members in the squad
* A minimum skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
* A weekly schedule of activities for the squad. This can be as simple as office hours, or as extensive as project deadlines
* An end date or condition for the squad

Once these items have been defined you can start promoting your squad to our general members. 
When you reach your minimum members you can set a start date on your squad.

### Running a squad

While your squad is running be sure to:
* stick to the schedule
* Keep seeking feedback from your squad mates
* If you're the squadleader reach out to your fellow mentors at least twice a month
* If you're the squadleader reach out to a mentorship staff member at least twice a month

### Ending a squad

When your squads goal has been met the following actions should be completed:
* Notify mentorship staff members
* Write up a brief overview of what the squad completed and share it with #general
